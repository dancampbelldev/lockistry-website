Controls how pins bind and set.\n\nTechnique:\n- Use extremely light pressure for security pins.\n- Reduce tension when spools or serrations counter-rotate.\n- Increase slightly if pins feel loose.\n\nBest for:\n- All lock types\n- Learning feedback and tactile control"

      "text": "Primary use: Single Pin Picking (SPP)\n\nThe hook pick is the most precise tool, perfect for individually lifting pins to their exact shear line. Ideal for high-quality locks or those with narrow keyways.\n\nTechnique:\n- Apply very light tension.\n- Test pins front to back to find the binding pin.\n- Lift slowly until a clear click or reduction in tension occurs.\n- Repeat until plug rotates.\n\nBest for:\n- Standard pin tumbler locks\n- Spool, serrated, and mushroom pins\n- Deep-set or isolated pins\n- Paracentric keyways"
